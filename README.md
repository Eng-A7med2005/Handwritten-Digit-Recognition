# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This is a beginner-friendly **Computer Vision** project that uses deep learning to recognize handwritten digits from images using the **MNIST** dataset.

Built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, this project demonstrates the full pipeline of an image classification task using a simple feedforward neural network.
